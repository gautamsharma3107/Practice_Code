# Basic Concepts in C++

## Variables and Data Types
- **Variables**: Named storage locations in memory that hold data.
- **Data Types**: Defines the type of data a variable can hold. Common data types include:
  - `int`: Integer type
  - `float`: Floating-point type
  - `double`: Double precision floating-point type
  - `char`: Character type
  - `bool`: Boolean type

### Problem Exercises
1. Create a program that declares variables of different data types and prints their sizes.

## Constants and Literals
- **Constants**: Fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program.
- **Literals**: Notation for representing a fixed value in source code (e.g., `10`, `3.14`, `'A'`).

### Problem Exercises
1. Write a program that uses constants to define the value of Pi and calculates the area of a circle.

## Input/Output Operations
- **Input**: Using `cin` to take input from the user.
- **Output**: Using `cout` to display output to the console.

### Problem Exercises
1. Create a program that takes user input for two numbers and outputs their sum.

## Operators
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

### Problem Exercises
1. Write a program that takes two integers and performs all arithmetic operations on them.

## Type Conversions
- **Implicit Conversion**: Automatic conversion by the compiler.
- **Explicit Conversion**: Manual conversion using casting.

### Problem Exercises
1. Create a program that demonstrates both implicit and explicit type conversions.

## Scope of Variables
- **Local Scope**: Variables declared inside a function.
- **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside any function.

### Problem Exercises
1. Write a program that demonstrates the difference between local and global variables.
