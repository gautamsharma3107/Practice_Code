# Advanced Algorithm Techniques

This document covers advanced algorithm techniques that are essential for solving complex problems efficiently. The following topics will be discussed:

## 1. Divide and Conquer
- **Definition**: A strategy that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem independently, and combines their solutions to solve the original problem.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Recursive approach
  - Reduces problem size at each step
  - Often leads to efficient algorithms
- **Examples**:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Binary Search

### Problem Exercises:
- [Merge Sort Implementation](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/)
- [Quick Sort Implementation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/)
- [Binary Search Implementation](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

## 2. Greedy Algorithms
- **Definition**: An algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Makes locally optimal choices
  - Does not always lead to a globally optimal solution
- **Examples**:
  - Activity Selection Problem
  - Huffman Coding
  - Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for Minimum Spanning Tree

### Problem Exercises:
- [Activity Selection Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/activity-selection-problem-greedy-algo-1/)
- [Huffman Coding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/huffman-coding-greedy-algo-3/)
- [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm/)

## 3. Dynamic Programming
- **Definition**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Overlapping subproblems
  - Optimal substructure
- **Examples**:
  - Fibonacci Sequence
  - Knapsack Problem
  - Longest Common Subsequence

### Problem Exercises:
- [Fibonacci Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)
- [0/1 Knapsack Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/)
- [Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

## 4. Backtracking
- **Definition**: A general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, particularly constraint satisfaction problems, by incrementally building candidates and abandoning a candidate as soon as it is determined that it cannot lead to a valid solution.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Recursive approach
  - Explores all possibilities
  - Prunes branches that cannot yield a valid solution
- **Examples**:
  - N-Queens Problem
  - Sudoku Solver
  - Permutations and Combinations

### Problem Exercises:
- [N-Queens Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)
- [Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/)
- [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)
