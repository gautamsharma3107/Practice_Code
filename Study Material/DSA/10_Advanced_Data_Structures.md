# Advanced Data Structures

This document covers advanced data structures that are essential for efficient algorithm design and implementation. Understanding these structures will enhance your problem-solving skills and enable you to tackle complex programming challenges.

## 1. Trie (Prefix Tree)
- **Definition**: A trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings.
- **Use Cases**: Autocomplete systems, spell checkers, and IP routing.
- **Operations**:
  - Insertion
  - Search
  - Deletion
- **Complexity**: O(m) for search, insert, and delete, where m is the length of the string.

### Problem Exercises:
- Implement a trie and perform insert, search, and delete operations.
- [LeetCode Problem: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)

## 2. Segment Trees
- **Definition**: A segment tree is a binary tree used for storing intervals or segments. It allows querying which segments overlap with a given point.
- **Use Cases**: Range queries, such as sum, minimum, maximum, and greatest common divisor.
- **Operations**:
  - Build
  - Update
  - Query
- **Complexity**: O(log n) for update and query operations.

### Problem Exercises:
- Build a segment tree for range sum queries.
- [LeetCode Problem: Range Sum Query - Mutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-mutable/)

## 3. Disjoint Sets (Union-Find)
- **Definition**: A disjoint set is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.
- **Use Cases**: Network connectivity, Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.
- **Operations**:
  - Find
  - Union
- **Complexity**: O(α(n)) for both operations, where α is the inverse Ackermann function.

### Problem Exercises:
- Implement union-find with path compression and union by rank.
- [LeetCode Problem: Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/)

## 4. Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
- **Definition**: A Fenwick tree is a data structure that provides efficient methods for cumulative frequency tables.
- **Use Cases**: Range sum queries and updates.
- **Operations**:
  - Update
  - Query
- **Complexity**: O(log n) for both operations.

### Problem Exercises:
- Implement a Fenwick tree for range sum queries.
- [LeetCode Problem: Range Sum Query - Immutable](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/)

## 5. Suffix Trees and Arrays
- **Definition**: A suffix tree is a compressed trie containing all the suffixes of a given string. A suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a string.
- **Use Cases**: String matching, longest common substring, and data compression.
- **Operations**:
  - Build
  - Search
- **Complexity**: O(n) for building a suffix tree.

### Problem Exercises:
- Build a suffix tree for a given string and perform search operations.
- [LeetCode Problem: Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/)

## 6. Bloom Filters
- **Definition**: A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.
- **Use Cases**: Caching, database queries, and network security.
- **Operations**:
  - Insert
  - Query
- **Complexity**: O(k) for both operations, where k is the number of hash functions.

### Problem Exercises:
- Implement a Bloom filter and test its performance.
- [LeetCode Problem: Design a HashSet](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)
