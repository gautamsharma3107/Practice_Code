# Problem-Solving Strategies

This document covers various strategies and techniques for effective problem-solving in programming, particularly in the context of data structures and algorithms.

## 1. Problem Decomposition
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- Solve each sub-problem independently and combine solutions.

### Exercises:
- [LeetCode Problem: Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- [HackerRank Problem: Recursive Digit Sum](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/recursive-digit-sum/problem)

## 2. Pattern Recognition
- Identify common patterns in problems to apply known solutions.
- Familiarize yourself with common algorithms and data structures.

### Exercises:
- [LeetCode Problem: Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)
- [CodeSignal Problem: Array Manipulation](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade/intro/level-3/2y9g9)

## 3. Time-Space Tradeoffs
- Understand the balance between time complexity and space complexity.
- Optimize solutions based on constraints.

### Exercises:
- [LeetCode Problem: Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
- [HackerRank Problem: Maximum Subarray](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/max-subarray/problem)

## 4. Incremental Approach
- Start with a simple solution and iteratively improve it.
- Test and refine your solution at each step.

### Exercises:
- [LeetCode Problem: Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
- [Codewars Problem: Sum of Two Lowest Positive Integers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-of-two-lowest-positive-integers/train/javascript)

## 5. Iterative Refinement
- Continuously refine your solution based on feedback and testing.
- Use debugging techniques to identify and fix issues.

### Exercises:
- [LeetCode Problem: Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)
- [HackerRank Problem: Counting Valleys](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/counting-valleys/problem)

## 6. Competitive Programming Strategies
- Practice regularly on competitive programming platforms.
- Participate in contests to improve speed and accuracy.

### Exercises:
- [Codeforces Problem: Watermelon](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A)
- [AtCoder Problem: ABC086A - Product](https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc086/tasks/abc086_a)

## 7. Interview Problem-Solving Techniques
- Familiarize yourself with common interview questions and patterns.
- Practice explaining your thought process clearly.

### Exercises:
- [LeetCode Problem: Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
- [HackerRank Problem: 2D Array - DS](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/2d-array/problem)
