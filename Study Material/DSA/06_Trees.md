# Trees Data Structures Notes

This file contains detailed notes on tree data structures, including their types, properties, and applications. It also includes problem exercises with links to relevant coding platforms for practice.

## 1. Binary Trees
- **Definition**: A tree data structure where each node has at most two children referred to as the left child and the right child.
- **Properties**:
  - The maximum number of nodes at level `l` is `2^l`.
  - The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height `h` is `2^(h+1) - 1`.
  - The minimum height of a binary tree with `n` nodes is `⌊log2(n)⌋`.

### Exercises:
- Implement a binary tree in C++.
- [Binary Tree Implementation Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-implementation/)

## 2. Binary Search Trees (BST)
- **Definition**: A binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child only nodes with values greater than the parent node.
- **Operations**:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Searching

### Exercises:
- Implement a binary search tree with insertion and search functions.
- [Binary Search Tree Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-1-search-and-insertion/)

## 3. Self-Balancing Trees
- **Definition**: A binary search tree that automatically keeps itself balanced during insertions and deletions.
- **Types**:
  - AVL Tree
  - Red-Black Tree

### Exercises:
- Implement an AVL tree with rotation operations.
- [AVL Tree Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/)

## 4. B-Trees
- **Definition**: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
- **Properties**:
  - A B-tree of order `m` can have at most `m` children and at least `⌈m/2⌉` children.

### Exercises:
- Implement a B-tree and perform insertion and deletion operations.
- [B-Tree Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/b-tree-set-1-introduction/)

## 5. Heaps
- **Definition**: A special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
- **Types**:
  - Max Heap
  - Min Heap

### Exercises:
- Implement a max heap and min heap with insertion and deletion operations.
- [Heap Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort/)

## 6. Tree Traversals
- **Types**:
  - In-order Traversal
  - Pre-order Traversal
  - Post-order Traversal
  - Level-order Traversal

### Exercises:
- Implement tree traversal algorithms for a binary tree.
- [Tree Traversal Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/)

## 7. Tree-Based Problems
- Common problems involving trees include:
  - Finding the height of a tree
  - Checking if a tree is balanced
  - Finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes

### Exercises:
- Solve problems related to tree height and balance checking.
- [Tree Height Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-height-binary-tree/)
- [Lowest Common Ancestor Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-in-a-binary-tree/)
